Here is the list of my projects on Github :
As a Java Full Stack Developer in 2025, employers expect to see projects that showcase:

    Backend Mastery with Spring Boot / Jakarta EE

    Frontend Experience (React, Angular, Vue, etc.)

    Database design and integration (SQL + NoSQL)

    RESTful and/or GraphQL API development

    Security (JWT, OAuth2)

    DevOps Exposure (Docker, CI/CD, etc.)

    Clean Code Practices (TDD, SOLID, etc.)

Here are cool, modern, and practical project ideas that will make your GitHub shine for 2025:
‚úÖ 1. AI-Powered Personal Finance Manager

    Tech Stack: Spring Boot + React + GPT API (or Ollama for local models) + MongoDB + Docker

    Features:

        User auth (JWT)

        Upload bank statements (CSV)

        Uses AI to classify expenses

        Budget tracker & reports

        Charts with Recharts or Chart.js

    Why it‚Äôs great: Showcases AI integration, data processing, frontend visualization.

‚úÖ 2. Job Portal with Resume Parser

    Tech Stack: Spring Boot + Angular + PostgreSQL + Apache Tika / NLP

    Features:

        Employer/jobseeker registration

        Resume upload & parsing (auto-extract skills)

        Job recommendations

    Why: Highlights backend-heavy logic, file parsing, and search/filtering algorithms.

‚úÖ 3. E-Commerce SaaS (Multitenant)

    Tech Stack: Spring Boot + React + Redis + Kafka + PostgreSQL + Keycloak (OAuth2)

    Features:

        Vendor onboarding

        Product listing, cart, checkout

        Payment gateway mock (Stripe API)

        Admin panel & analytics

    Why: Enterprise-level architecture, multitenancy, security, asynchronous messaging.

‚úÖ 4. Real-Time Collaboration Tool (like Google Docs lite)

    Tech Stack: Java (WebSockets) + React + Redis + MongoDB

    Features:

        Real-time text sync (Quill.js or similar)

        Share & collaborate

        Save version history

    Why: Demonstrates WebSockets, real-time processing, full-stack synergy.

‚úÖ 5. Developer Portfolio Builder (Drag & Drop CMS)

    Tech Stack: Spring Boot + Next.js + PostgreSQL + TailwindCSS

    Features:

        Drag & drop blocks (bio, projects, skills)

        JSON-based storage

        Export to static site

    Why: Great for frontend + backend + export automation.

‚úÖ 6. IoT Dashboard for Smart Home Devices

    Tech Stack: Spring Boot + Vue.js + MQTT + InfluxDB

    Features:

        Register sensors/devices

        Live dashboard (temperature, motion, etc.)

        Alerts & automation

    Why: Combines Java with hardware protocols, time-series data.

‚úÖ 7. Fullstack Blogging Platform with AI Summarizer

    Tech Stack: Spring Boot + React + GPT/LLM integration + PostgreSQL

        Generate QR tickets

        Scan + validate on entry

    Why: Backend API + web + mobile + QR integration.

‚úÖ 10. Custom LLM App: Ask My Code

    Tech Stack: Spring Boot + React + Vector DB (e.g., Qdrant) + Ollama/OpenAI

    Features:

        Upload codebase

        AI answers questions about the code

    Why: Highlights Java with AI, embeddings, RAG (retrieval augmented generation).

üîß Bonus Tips

    Add README.md with clear architecture diagrams, tech stack, demo links.

    Use GitHub Actions for CI/CD pipelines.

    Include unit + integration tests (Junit + Mockito).

    Containerize using Docker, and optionally deploy to Render, Fly.io, or AWS EC2.
